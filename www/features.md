# Viper Features

## Web based

Any phone, tablet, or computer with a web browser can use Viper. Its interface is mobile friendly using responsive web design. The back-end is designed to be simple enough to run on most web servers with very simple setup.

## Built-in data analysis

Viper creates data visualizations including graphs and heat maps. While you can also download the raw data, there is usually no need to use third party tools like Excel or Tableau to analyze the data.  For an example see:  [2024 Week 0 Stats â€” Viper Demo](https://demo.viperscout.com/stats.html#event=2024week0)
