## Testimonials

I just want to express my appreciation for the scouting system - Viper!

Since we don't have enough members this year,  building the robot and developing our own scouting system at the same time is impossible. Therefore, we searched online and saw if there's any open-source project that can be simply used.

And - we found Viper. The documentation is clear, so we rented a server, and deployed Viper successfully. It only took us an hour to make the system online!

Thank you for your hard work, that really helped us a lot. Please keep making this project available in the future!ðŸ˜Š
