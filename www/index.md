## Testimonials

### Team 7636 Robomania, Taichung, Chinese Taipei  

I just want to express my appreciation for the scouting system - Viper!

Since we don't have enough members this year,  building the robot and developing our own scouting system at the same time is impossible. Therefore, we searched online and saw if there's any open-source project that can be simply used.

And - we found Viper. The documentation is clear, so we rented a server, and deployed Viper successfully. It only took us an hour to make the system online!

Thank you for your hard work, that really helped us a lot. Please keep making this project available in the future!ðŸ˜Š

### Team 1772, GravataÃ­, Brazil

Team 1772 used Viper during the 2024 season, and it really leveled up our picklist process and understanding of other teams. It also made a big difference in how our students feel about scouting. At the start of the season, scouting felt like a chore, and nobody wanted to do it. Now, we have 7 students genuinely interested in scouting (around 35% of our team), and weâ€™re sure Viper had a lot to do with that. It made scouting easier and more fun, especially with the data visualization that helped scouters see the impact of their work. Thanks again for creating such an awesome tool!
